    "Realistically - no well defined answer, but there's 3 things people mean when they say \"agent\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLMs working independently**\n",
    "    - Can reliably use interfaces like a web browser, API, etc.\n",
    "    - Make decisions with little to no human guidance\n",
    "    - Ex. LLM reviews and automatically organizes PRs on GitHub.\n",
    "2. **LLMs working with other LLMs**\n",
    "    - Why multiple agents? Either they exist via multiple parties (ex. Microsoft coding agent tries to fix bug with Nvidia coding agent for a Windows CUDA bug), or each LLM has a specific task and does it well\n",
    "3. **LLMs improving based on feedback from environment**\n",
    "    - Just as humans do, LLMs react to new information around them and adjust accordingly - similar to #1.\n",
    "    - Ex. In the event of a system outage LLM redirects customers of a service to alternative offerings, notifies them of the outage, etc.\n",

    "    * Create graphs with 1+ LLMs to work together\n",
    "    * Comprehensive SDK (also kind of complicated, best for complex setups)\n",
    "* [outlines (dottext-ai)](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines)\n",
    "    * Enables structured text generation (i.e. CSV, JSON schemas, custom grammar, etc.)\n",
    "    * Helps feed LLM output into API/other tool\n",
    "* [MCP - Model Context Protocol (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)\n",
    "    * USB for LLMs - connect different APIs/tools with LLMs\n",
    "    * Another way to think about it - app store for LLMs to extend their functionality\n",
    "    * Try it in Claude Desktop!\n",
    "    * One missing feature: no webhook support"

    "\n",
    "1. Finish the demo: Your job is to design + implement a system that can autonomously perform the housing search for you - the demo finds leads as it is, but the website/listing may be out of date, may require filling out an application, etc. The system is up to you, but there should be a strong case that the user does not have to perform more work than laying out their housing needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas:\n",
    "* Email MCP to reach out to property managers to inquire for housing\n",
    "* Find roommates on social networks (Discord, SMS, etc.) with your accounts to find someone to live with.\n",
    "* Google Maps MCP API to find housing more reliably, find nearby places (e.g. you want to live close to your work office).\n",
    "* Be creative, think of something yourself!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Come up with your own problem to automate with agents!! Some ideas:\n",
    "* **Joining a lab at GT:** A lot of people have trouble finding an interesting lab to join that is willing to take them. Design a system that can find labs at GT, email the professor with a well-crafted message, and highlight your own relevant skills.\n",
    "* **Proactive securities market researcher:** People miss out on good times to buy stocks (think gamestop, tarriff drop, etc.) - have a system ingest new info as it comes in and evaluate whether it's worth buying/selling/doing something else.\n",
